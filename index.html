title: Home Hospital Teaching
---

<p>The Home and Hospital Teaching Program is designed to provide instructional continuity to students who are unable to attend their regular school of enrollment due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical illness or disability</li>
  <li>Emotional crisis (including substance abuse)</li>
  <li>Pregnancy</li>
  <li>Concurrent Enrollment or Chronic Illness (CHIP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Only when students are unable to participate in their regular educational program because of overriding physical or emotional conditions should the Home Hospital Teaching Program be considered.</p>

<p>Educational programs can be provided at the home, child's school, or in a public facility located in Howard County.</p>

<!-- <p>It is a short-term, itinerant instructional service mandated by State law with specific guidelines for program implementation and delivery. These educational services enable students to continue their academic work and to remain current with their peers as they prepare for their eventual return to their home schools. Home teaching is provided only during the academic year except for students whose Individualized Education Programs provide for additional instruction beyond the regular school calendar. Instruction is provided in the home of the student, in a hospital, or in a community setting.</p>-->
