<p>In addition to the documentation required for the application process, the IEP Team must meet to review and revise the IEP, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The IEP Team shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine the instructional services to be provided to the student as long as the medical and/or emotional restrictions apply</li>
  <li>Develop a plan for returning the student to a school-based program.</li>
  <li>Review the students' progress every 30 calendar days at an IEP Team meeting until the student returns to school. After 30 days, the IEP team should meet to plan for the student's return to an appropriate educational placement.</li>
