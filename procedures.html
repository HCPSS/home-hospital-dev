<h2>Parents</h2>

<p>Continually collaborate with your child's school administration, medical personnel, </p>

<p>After your child is enrolled in the Home and Hospital Teaching program, there are guidelines for a successful experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a quiet and safe location for the teaching to take place</li>
  <li>Provide a responsible adult over the age of 21 years old to supervise in the home for the entire time the teacher is there or assist in locating a community center, library, or other location where the student can meet the teacher.</li>
  <li>Keep both the school and the home and hospital teacher informed of any lesson cancellations, along with assisting both parties on collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transitioning</h3>

<p>According to COMAR, Home and Hospital is a temporary support service, and not an alternative placement. From the beginning of the process, emphasis is placed on returning the student to school. Often times, this means that approximately 30 days after teaching is implemented, the school should consider if the student might be ready to return to school in another 30 days.</p>

<p>Once the school team and/or private therapist or physician feels that the student may be ready to return to school, methods of enhancing transition back to school should be developed by the team. Schools have found the following transitional strategies and supports to be helpful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The student initially attends school part of the day, often for as little as one period.</li>
  <li>The student returns for a small amount of time to meet with the school psychologist or counselor and engages in nonacademic activities or actively plans for his or her return to school.</li>
  <li>The student’s daily schedule is modified to best meet current needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is determined that the student is incapable of returning to school and is still in need of Home and Hospital services after the 60-day time limit, need must be re-verified in the same manner as the initial referral. </p>

<h2>School Administrators</h2>

<p>Administrators help to develop a procedure in the school for establishing a linkage with the Home and Hospital Teaching Program, either through the Administrator’s Office or through the Guidance Office.</p>

<p>Some of their responsibilites include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informing faculty and staff about the availability of Home and Hospital Teaching programs for homebound and hospitalized students.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that all protocols are followed when reviewing applications and establishing a plan for Home and Hospital Teaching students.</li>
  <li>Attending all school-based meetings (e.g. IIT, SST, IEP, 504, H&amp;H 30 Day Review, H&amp;H 60 Day Review, etc.) when students receiving Home and Hospital Teaching are reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance and/or Case Manager</h2>

<p>Guidance Staff along with Case Managers talk with parents about the availability of Home and Hospital Teaching when the student will be absent from school for a projected period of at least three (3) weeks.</p>

<p>They also are the primary facilitators for the process of enrolling and participating in Home and Hospital Teaching, as well as transitioning students back to their regular school environment.</p>

<p>Some of their responsibilites include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assisting designated staff in completing and forwarding all forms to the Pupil Personnel Worker for the Home and Hospital Teaching Program once the program is deemed appropriate by the school team</li>
  <li>Conducting a 30-calendar day review when deemed necessary. A review of the Home and Hospital placement should be held 30-calendar days from the commencement of the program. This review will be done through the school Problem-Solving Team.</li>
  <li>Ensuring minutes are kept at all meetings where Home and Hospital Teaching is discussed.</li>
  <li>Developing or augmenting a Transition Plan with the assistance of the school team as needed for medical conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classrooom Teacher</h2>

<p>Teachers remain in contact with the Home and Hospital Teacher and assist with making modifications to the curriculum required for the student's homebound situation. They are required to respond to the Home and Hospital Teacher's request for work and return it to Guidance Office within 48 hours.</p>

<p>This typically means providing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two copies of all necessary texts, unless student already has his/her own. A teacher’s edition is also helpful.</li>
  <li>A brief list of units/chapters/assessments (not necessarily daily lesson plans).</li>
  <li>Two copies of handouts/worksheets</li>
</ul>

<p>They also ensure the Home and Hospital teacher's grades are averaged proportionately with classroom grades and placed on the report card. These grades are considered to be final grades.</p>
