<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>The Home and Hospital Teaching Program is provided by part-time teachers who instruct students on an individual basis in a home school, home, hospital, or community setting. Teachers act as the liaison among students, parents, and home school in an effort to help students remain current with their regular classes.</p>

<p>Students typically receive six instructional hours a week on full-time Home and Hospital Teaching, unless otherwise recommended by the Home and Hospital teacher, IEP team or Problem Solving Team.</p>

<p>Home and Hospital Teachers are also expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce themselves to both the parents of the student and the home school's staff.</li>
  <li>Attend 60-day re-verification, 30-day review, and IEP team meetings, when appropriate.</li>
  <li>Teach students only in the presence of an adult. Teachers will never transport a student. </li>
  <li>At the conclusion of the assignment, give the parent or guardian a parent feedback form to be completed and returned to the Home and Hospital Teaching Office.</li>
</ul>
