title: Home Hospital Teaching Eligibility
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Students in Howard County who have verification from a physician, psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or certified school psychologist that a medical or emotional condition or illness which prevents them from participating in a school-based program may be eligible for Home and Hospital Teaching services.</p>

<p>The student must anticipate being out of school for sufficient time (approximately three or more  weeks) or have a chronic health problem which causes absences from school in excess of 20 percent of the time to make this program feasible.</p>

<h2>Qualifying conditions</h2>

<h3>Emotional Crisis</h3>

<p>Students may receive 60 consecutive calendar days if the student does not have an IEP, and a maximum 60 consecutive school days, upon approval, for students with IEPs. The student has to receive a reccommendation by a licensed psychiatrist, a certified school psychologist, or licensed psychologist who is currently providing treatment.</p>

<p>A transition plan geared towards helping the student return to their normal school schedule needs to be included as part of the application, and should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The diagnosed emotional condition</li> 
  <li>Medical and therapeutic intervention</li>
  <li>How implementing the transition plan will result in returning the student to school</li> 
</ul>

<p>Home and Hospital Teaching may be appropriate for students who require brief periods of hospitalization, stays in a therapeutic treatment center, day treatment, or upon returning from psychiatric hospitalization.</p>

<h3>Physical Illness</h3>

<p>A licensed physician must describe the specific illness and indicate that the illness prevents the student from attending school. A statement that the student will be absent for an anticipated period of three weeks or more is required as well.</p>

<p>Description on the application must include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Date of the most recent examination</li>
  <li>Anticipated length of the illness</li>
  <li>Description of the medical problem</li>
  <li>Indication of whether or not the illness is contagious</li>
  <li>Physician’s signature</li>
  <li>Date that the form is completed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Concurrent Enrollment or Chronic Illness (CHIP)</h3>

<p>Students diagnosed as having chronic illnesses (such as asthma, cancer, sickle cell anemia, kidney failure, juvenile diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or cardiac disorders) are eligible for services without an anticipated three-week absence. The physician’s statement on the application needs to indicate that the illness will cause intermittent absences over the course of the school year.</p>

<p>This program is ideal for students with conditions that occassionally keep them out of school for short periods of time (20 percent or more absences per month), but are able to meet with a Home and Hospital teacher frequent enough to complete their courses.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy</h3>

<p>Howard County students who are pregnant attend their home school prior to the birth of their children.</p>

<p>Generally, obstetricians are reluctant to recommend Home and Hospital Teaching for expectant mothers in good health except for the final weeks before delivery. They are entitled to receive Home and Hospital Teaching for six to eight weeks following delivery. Complications of pregnancy are handled on a case-by-case basis. Home and Hospital Teaching may not be extended because of childcare limitations or the illness of the baby.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

<h3>Student in facilities outside of Howard County</h3>

<p>If a student is placed in a hospital or a therapeutic treatment center outside the county, that educational jurisdiction notifies the Home and Hospital Office.</p>

<p>The student's school cannot authorize payment for Home and Hospital Teaching at these facilities. Referrals must be made through the Home and Hospital Office (410-313-6822) to assure proper student identification, eligibility, billing, and grading.</p>
